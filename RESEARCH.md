Absolutely — this is a great write-up, so fun names that feel open-sourcey, hacker-friendly, and food/health adjacent will fit perfectly. I’ll give you several themed buckets so you can pick based on tone (serious, playful, nerdy, or brand-ready).

🧩 Section Title Ideas (If this is a blog or doc section)

Instead of a “project name,” these work well as headers:
	•	“The Open-Source Calorie Stack”
	•	“Surveying the Open Nutrition Ecosystem”
	•	“An Atlas of Open Food Tracking”
	•	“The State of Open-Source Nutrition Tracking”
	•	“A Field Guide to Open-Source Food Logs”

My Top 5 Picks (based on your content)

If I had to narrow it down:
	1.	The Open-Source Calorie Stack
	2.	FoodLedger
	3.	Calories as Code
	4.	The Open Pantry
	5.	Quantified Kitchen

If you want, tell me:
	•	whether this is a repo name, blog title, internal doc, or product codename
	•	and whether you want serious vs playful

…and I’ll refine it down to something perfectly on-brand.
